## ABSTRACT

In 2015, The Washington Post began tracking more than a dozen details about each killing — including the race of the deceased, the circumstances of the shooting, whether the person was armed and whether the victim was experiencing a mental-health crisis — by pulling local news reports, law enforcement websites and social media and by monitoring independent databases such as [Killed by Police](https://killedbypolice.net/) and [Fatal Encounters](https://fatalencounters.org/).

The Post is documenting only those shootings in which a police officer, in the line of duty, shot and killed a civilian — the circumstances that most closely parallel the 2014 killing of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, which began the protest movement culminating in Black Lives Matter and an increased focus on police accountability nationwide. The Post is not tracking deaths of people in police custody, fatal shootings by off-duty officers or non-shooting deaths.

The FBI and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention log fatal shootings by police, but officials acknowledge that their data is incomplete. In 2015, The Post documented more than two times more fatal shootings by police than had been recorded by the FBI.

According the Las Vegas Review-Journal: Deadly Force, "The nation’s leading law enforcement agency [FBI] collects vast amounts of information on crime nationwide, but missing from this clearinghouse are statistics on where, how often, and under what circumstances police use deadly force. In fact, no one anywhere comprehensively tracks the most significant act police can do in the line of duty: take a life."


In hopes to be more informed on this matter, I would like to investigate:

1. Due to the current climate around Black Lives Matter, are African-Americans shot a higher rate?
2. What are the type of weapons in possession of the victim? Does it differ among racial groups?
3. What are the differences, if any, in age group among the racial groups?
4. Identify any trends in shooting on a monthly and yearly basis.
5. Due to the rise in police brutality claims and proven videos, have police departments increased body camera footage to ensure accountability on tactics?
